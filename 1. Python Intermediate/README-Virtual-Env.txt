For having Virtual Environments we can add them in the Terminal with the following command: 

    ```python  -m venv [Name of the Env you want]```

by running that, we will have a new folder on Desktop which is the Virtual Environment. 


For accessing the Virtual Environment on Windows, we can use the following command in CMD: 

    ```.\[Name of the Virtual Environment]\Scripts\activate```


For exiting the Virtual Environment we use the following command: 

    ```deactivate``` in terminal
